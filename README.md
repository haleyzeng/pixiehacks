### A project by Amy Xu, Laura Goon, Celine Yan, and Haley Zeng
### Pixie Hacks 2016

Our project, still a WIP, includes a website that calls a processing file to make various changes to a given photo. The file adds several colored filters (orange, pink/purple, and blue) and also adds stickers to the picture by clicking on buttons presented below the image. Once all of the changes are made, the picture is saved.
