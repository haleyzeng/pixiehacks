### A project by Amy Xu, Laura Goon, Celine Yan, and Haley Zeng
### Pixie Hacks 2016

Our project, still a WIP, includes a website that calls a processing file to make various changes to a given photo. The file adds several colored filters (orange, pink/purple, and blue) and also adds stickers to the picture by clicking on buttons presented below the image. Once all of the changes are made, the picture is saved. 

In order to run the website, you will need to install a local server enviornment, MAMP, and Processing. You will also need to download all the folders and files on this github for everything to run smoothly.
